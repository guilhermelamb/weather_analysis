# weather_analysis
This is the first project I've made in the field of data analysis.

This is also the first project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

In this project, I analyze weather trends for the capital of my state (Porto Alegre). 
First I used SQL commands to gather data from a database and then used Microsoft Excel to calculate moving average and MSE (mean squared error) for the temperature data. 

After that, I plotted a line chart and computed a simple linear regression to make some predictions.
